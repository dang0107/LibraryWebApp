# LibraryWebApp
* Implement a simplified version of a Library application to manage books available in the library: adding, removing, changing quantity.
* Built using ASP.NET and C# with SQL Server.

## Things I have done:
* Admin login, User login and user registration
* Admin able to add, edit, remove and search books by either book title or author name
* Table allow paging and sorting by book titles and author names

## Things I haven't done:
* A book can be taken by diffrent people and at a different time
* Registration is required to take books
* Implement filter that show available books / books taken by user.


## Getting Started
* Download the project
* Open project with Visual Studio
* Open SQl Server and run the sql script(sql_script.sql) that I have provided
* Set admin_login.aspx as start page then run the program
* In the Admin Login Page, login in by typing these:
   * email: admin@gmail.com
   * password: admin
